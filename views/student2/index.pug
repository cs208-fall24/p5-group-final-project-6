        h2 About Us
        p Welcome to the prestigious world of Underwater Basket Weaving, where we combine two completely unrelated activities—basket weaving and holding your breath underwater—into one utterly useless pursuit. At our institution, we believe in pushing the boundaries of impracticality, preparing students to... well, we’re not entirely sure what for. But we know for sure what not for... particularly everything!
      section#history
        h2 History
        p Our craft traces its origins to the moment when history's most unimaginatively bored weaver decided to take their skills underwater—purely because they had absolutely nothing better to do. Since then, we've proudly upheld this delightfully soggy legacy, proving that boredom can truly be the mother of questionable innovation.

          li How do you keep sharks from stealing your baskets?
