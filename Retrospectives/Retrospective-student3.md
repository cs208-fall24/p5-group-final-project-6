## Experience

Overall this was a fun and interesting project to work on. I am glad that we finally got a project that integrated the front end and the back end together to create a cohesive site. I enjoyed learning how to play around with the get calls to pass variables for the different students to make the code more generic for the team. It was also fun playing around more with HTML and CSS to get practice in formatting websites. The project was tested manually to confirm the functionality of the comments page, update page, and access to see comments on my student3 page as well as my comment page. The main topic I struggled with was the grid layout in CSS when trying to organize all the information for the main page. Ultimately, I just called it once I got something good enough and moved on to focus on getting functional backend code. The entire project was able to be completed and I was able to work with my team to make more generic functions that we could all use for our comment sections which was really fun to work on. Over the winter break, I plan to learn React and implement the front end of a web app so I am excited to get to implement my current knowledge along side some new knowledge as I keep learning.
