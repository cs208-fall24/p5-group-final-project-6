## Experience

This project was a great opportunity to learn how to create a website from scratch with a database.I had a lot of fun working with HTML and CSS to customize the website’s design and functionality, which allowed me to see the immediate results of my changes. I really enjoyed working on both the frontend and backend code, though I found GitHub tasks, particularly merging, to be a bit challenging. I ended up doing a force merge, but fortunately, my teammate Oliver was able to save most of the previous code, which I’m really grateful for as it allowed us to continue moving forward without losing significant progress.
