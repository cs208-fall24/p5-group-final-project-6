## Experience

This was rather fun to do. This page allowed me to play with words and the website in general so as to add a fun website that was party-like (major given to me as I am student 1). The experience overall went smoothly, and it was really nice to check on my teammates as I coded in the program, it was helpful. I also want to give shout-out to Oliver that pretty much shared his comment code with all of us. This teamwork of his, demonstrated how working in a company would be like. Because truly, I would have had to do some extra reseach so as to add the comment part of the code and he was a life-saver.
Overall this entire experience was fun, and I feel like this final project truly demonstrated what working in a company would be like. Working as a team on how to do a code, decide on different designs given the content you have, decide on words and phrases for your project and so on. Once again, this entire project was extremely enjoyable.
